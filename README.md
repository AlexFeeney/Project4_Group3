# General description
“Globally, the World Health Organisation estimates that there are at least 62 million stroke survivors. In Australia, 50,000 people suffer a stroke each year, leaving them with physical and mental disabilities that create an enormous emotional, social, and financial burden on our community.” (https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain/brain-diseases/stroke/stroke-facts#:~:text=Strokes,financial%20burden%20on%20our%20community).

Our group aims to utilize a well documented dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset to generate models to predict wether a patient likely to have stroke or not based on vary features such as age, average glucose level, bmi, etc. To do that, we had explored unsupervised (Kmeans, PCA) and supervised (neural network, logistic regression, random forest) machine learning methods. Our conclusion is supervised machine learning approaches have a great potential to predict wether a person likely to have stroke or not with the accuracy can be up to 96% in neural network - Keras model.
